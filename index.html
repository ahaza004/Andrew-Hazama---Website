        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">PreBusinessðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Andrew Hazama and I am currently a student attending the prestigious school of the University of California Riverside. I am currently in the PreBusiness program where I will transfer to the School of Business by my third year in college. The goal is to concentrate on marketing. The reason for this is because I love people. I am a huge people person and I love to talk and socialize with others. With this being said, this allows me to easily network and have many people around me. I am both extroverted and introverted, so I am able to understand people very well. To understand when people are drained and tired while others are excited and energetic, allows me to connect with them on a deeper level. Some of my strengths are that I am very hardworking, caring, genuine, responsible, honest, hopeful, optimistic, a good leader, smart, intelligent, loyal, and adaptable. <br><br>

        Some of my weaknesses are that I am a perfectionist, and I tend to push other people to their max limit of capacity to work, reasonably of course. When considering jobs to hire me, I look at my stats and work that I have accomplished. In HighSchool, I was part of many clubs. I was a leader for Link Crew and I taught many people in Diamond Bar about the school and the different buildings. I was basically a tour guide. I seem to feed off of other peopleâ€™s energy and I go the extra mile to be more enthusiastic. I love to bring out a person from their shell. I am super positive and always have a happy heart and am always ready to help. The factors that go into coming out of a personâ€™s shell is massive. All a person needs is love ultimately. When a person is able to listen and understand/empathize with a person. That person tends to open up and find more joy in the little things. <br><br>

        The emphasis on people is heavy as I believe relationships and team unity is important for a company to function. When people can come together and work as a team with as little problems as possible, that is when a company or group begins to thrive. I have a good sense of when people are going through something difficult. I am able to be there for a person and seek to help them. I am a lover of the color green and I find joy in happiness for the people there. I constantly seek to overcome fears am open to doing the things that nobody else wants to. In leadership roles, I can confidently say that I am able to lead a team and bring out each personâ€™s talents to better benefit the company. Leading a team is not easy, but with my abilities to lead and be a substantial role in a company allows not only me to excel, but the other people associated with the company. With all of this being said, I would be a great choice to be hired into a company or job.
